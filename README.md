1. You would <ins>NOT</ins> use a unit test to test out a message feature in a messaging application. This is because unit testing is used to test specific return values from the code. For example if you are expecting to recieve 4 from adding 2 + 2 that would be a valid test as there is an abosulte answer.
2. You <ins>WOULD</ins> use a unit test to test out the max message length feature as there is a specific value that the test is looking for and with unit testing that is exactly what we are looking for to see if that feautre is working correctly. As the unit tests will return the length of a message and compare it to the maximum character count allowed.
